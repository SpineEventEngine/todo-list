## `html-js`

Introducing the TodoList Web client.

Currently, the client is capable of creating and displaying simple tasks (i.e. tasks with 
a description only).

To run the client, open the `/client/html-js/app/index.html` with the most convenient 
way (e.g. from IDEA).

### Prerequirements

In order to launch the Web application successfully
 - start the local web server (see [`local-firebase`](../../deployment/local-firebase/README.md));
 - build the `html-js` Gradle project with `./gradlew :client:html-js:build` (the general 
 `./gradlew build` works as well).
