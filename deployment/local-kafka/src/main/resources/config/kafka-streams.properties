# This file contains the Kafka Streams configuration for the Kafka-based catch up.
#
# Note that Kafka Streams requires `application.id` property to be set. Though, Kafka catch up
# library auto-generates the value for this property, so any attempt to declare it externally is
# ignored silently.
#
# See KafkaCatchUp.start for more details.
# See https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#streamsconfigs for the detailed config description.

# A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster,
